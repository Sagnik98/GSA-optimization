**Implementation of Gravitational Search Algorithm**
				     *-by @Sagnik98*

An optimization algorithm based on the law of gravity and mass interactions.
The **Codes** are implemented in **GNU Octave**.
The **Result** consists of the plots of **best so far solution - iteration** 
along with **data.txt** containing average-best-so-far, median-best-so-far
and mean-fitness for each of the 23 functions **F1 - F23**.
