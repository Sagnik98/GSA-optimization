**Implementation of Gravitational Search Algorithm**
				     *-by @Sagnik98*

A population based *heuristic* search algorithm  based on the gravity rules.
The **Codes** are implemented in **GNU Octave**.
The **Result** consists of the plots of **best so far solution - iteration** 
along with **data.txt** containing average-best-so-far, median-best-so-far
and mean-fitness for each of the 23 functions **F1 - F23**.
